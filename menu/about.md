title: Introduction to OrthoFinder!
---

This site provides a series of tutorials for [OrthoFinder](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-015-0721-2). OrthoFinder is a software program for phylogenetic orthology inference and comparative genomics. What that means is that you provide it with the genes of the species you are interested in and it will:
* infer a complete set of rooted gene trees for those genes
* infer all orthology relationships between the genes using the gene trees
* infer gene duplication events and map them to the gene and species trees
* infer a rooted species tree
* provide comparative genomics statistics for your species

Even though OrthoFinder uses a more rigourous, gene-tree based approach instead of the standard BLAST-based approach to ortholog inference it is incredibly fast! The gene-tree based approach also allows it to calculate all the additional information listed above. 

### Tutorials

The intention for this site is to provide a series of tutorials that will guide you through getting started with OrthoFinder and analysing the results. The plan is for further tutorials on getting the most out of an OrthoFinder analysis, and more sophisticated analysis and visualisation based on OrthoFinder's results. In addition to these tutorials, the github page also provides a manual for OrthoFinder. These two resources are complementary and cover some of the same information. The manual provides more condensed information whereas these tutorials aim to guide you through the process.
