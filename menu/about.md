This site provides a series of tutorials for OrthoFinder. The homepage also provides a brief overview of its main advantages over other methods. The tutorials guide you through getting started with OrthoFinder and analysing the results. The plan is for further tutorials on getting the most out of an OrthoFinder analysis, and on more sophisticated analyses and visualisation based on OrthoFinder's results. In addition to these tutorials, the [github](https://github.com/davidemms/OrthoFinder) page also provides a manual for OrthoFinder which is useful as an independent reference.
