## Plan for this tutorial
In this tutorial we're going to download OrthoFinder and check we can run it on the Example Dataset. After doing that we'll be reading for the next tutorial where we run it on a more interesting set of species. All these steps will be done on the command line so that you can just copy and run the commands yourself. There are many online tutorials and reference pages if you're not used to the command line, here is a nice short one that covers the basics: <https://www.techspot.com/guides/835-linux-command-line-basics/>.

## Downloading and running OrthoFinder on Linux
There are a number of ways of obtaining OrthoFinder, the option below is the easiest on Linux. For Macs, or if you have any problems or you want to use another method, see: [Alternative ways of getting OrthoFinder]({% post_url 2019-10-19-alternative-ways-of-getting-OrthoFinder %}).


1. Create a directory to work in. Open a terminal and run the commands:
```
mkdir ~/orthofinder_tutorial
cd ~/orthofinder_tutorial
```

2. Download the latest version of OrthoFinder
```
wget https://github.com/davidemms/OrthoFinder/releases/latest/download/OrthoFinder.tar.gz
```
    
    > If you don't have wget installed, you can try curl:

    `curl -L -O https://github.com/davidemms/OrthoFinder/releases/latest/download/OrthoFinder.tar.gz`
    
    > Alternatively, go to the GitHub releases page and download OrthoFinder: <https://github.com/davidemms/OrthoFinder/releases>
    
3. Extract the package, and cd into the OrthoFinder directory
```
tar xzvf OrthoFinder.tar.gz
cd OrthoFinder/
```

4. Request OrthoFinder to print its help file
```
./orthofinder -h
```
This will print all the OrthoFinder command line options. 
    >If you have an old OS you might not have the required libc version and get an error which includes `version 'GLIBC_2.25' not found`. In this case, you can download a version of OrthoFinder using an older library: `wget https://github.com/davidemms/OrthoFinder/releases/latest/download/OrthoFinder_glibc-2.17.tar.gz` and use that.

5. Run OrthoFinder on the Example Dataset
```
./orthofinder -f ExampleData/
```

## A quick look at the results

When you run OrthoFinder you should get something like this:
```
~/orthofinder_tutorial$ ./orthofinder -f ExampleData/

Writing orthogroups to file
---------------------------
OrthoFinder assigned 2202 genes (80.6% of total) to 604 orthogroups. Fifty percent of all genes were in orthogroups with 4 or more genes (G50 was 4) and were contained in the largest 281 orthogroups (O50 was 281). There were 269 orthogroups with all species present and 246 of these consisted entirely of single-copy genes.

OrthoFinder creates a directory within the directory with your input files and puts all the results there, e.g.: `ExampleData/OrthoFinder/Results_Oct11`. This is what the results directory looks like:

<img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/results_directory.png">

If everything worked then you should have got a similar looking results directory. That's it, we're done!

In the next tutorial ([Running an example OrthoFinder analysis]({% post_url 2019-09-19-running-an-example-orthofinder-analysis %})) we will look at how to prepare and run our own analysis and after that there's a tutorial showing how to explore all the results.
