## Plan for this tutorial
In this tutorial we're going to download OrthoFinder and its dependencies and then run it on the example dataset. I'm going to be downloading everything to a directory called '/home/david/orthofinder-tutorial/', assuming you use something different then you'll need to change the commands accordingly. At the time of writing the latest version of OrthoFinder was 'OrthoFinder-2.3.3.tar.gz', you'll need to change the commands to whatever version number you are using.

## Downloading and setting up OrthoFinder

### 1. Download OrthoFinder
> Go to the [releases](https://github.com/davidemms/OrthoFinder) page on the OrthoFinder github site.

This page contains concise instructions for setting up and running OrthoFinder and describes the results files and various options. In comparison, this tutorial is going to guide you through the basics step by step.  

> Download the latest release (at the time of writing it's called OrthoFinder-2.3.3.tar.gz and is under 'Assets'.

The file needs to be extracted:
> Open a terminal, navigate to the directory where you downloaded OrthoFinder and extract 
```
cd /home/david/orthofinder-tutorial/
tar xzf OrthoFinder-2.3.3.tar.gz
```

This will extract a folder called 'OrthoFinder-2.3.3' into your current directory.

### 2. Install the dependencies

### 3. Get OrthoFinder to print its help file

### 4. Run OrthoFinder on the Example Dataset
